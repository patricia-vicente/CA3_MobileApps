## Report

A short report (300-1000 words) describing the challenges you faced, failed attempts and workarounds used, any helper or alternative libraries you have used, and what you have learned in the process. 
I felt many difficulties during the development of this app, always looking for videos and rewatching the classes. My app was always working, but in the end it stopped. I tried to fix it but couldn't. In addition to the screenshot, I'm sending a video that I sent to my classmate to show her the progress of my app while it was running.
